This is my final project for the 2024 Advanced Topics in CS course

Decided to dedicate my Independent project to AI and Machine Learning. I 
didn't get the chance to start the material, but I took a glance over the 
instruction, and I am excited to get the project underway.

Spent the day setting up my kaggle notebook and reviewing the introductory 
info on fastai. Next week I will begin work on the actual project.
