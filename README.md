Background
I chose to check out the Fast AI “Is it a bird” module for my independent project because I was interested in seeing how machine learning can be implemented at its simplest level. As part of the module, I trained my computer to recognize images that contained a bird using duck duck go’s image searching and to recognize images that were only forests. Then, the machine was able to be given an image and determine whether the photo was of a bird or of the forest.

How It Works
The images that I get from the internet searched are put into folders and labeled as either bird or forest photos. These photos are then analyzed by a computer to detect patterns associated with each of the categories of photo. Thus, when the model is given a photo, it can scan it for the patterns and determine if it has the graphical characteristics of a bird or forest.

Application and Implications of AI Image Detection
AI image detection has profound implications across various sectors, fundamentally transforming how we interact with visual information. In healthcare, it enhances diagnostic accuracy by identifying anomalies in medical images, leading to earlier and more accurate disease detection. In security, AI-powered surveillance systems can monitor and analyze real-time footage to detect suspicious activities, thereby bolstering public safety. The technology also revolutionizes the retail industry by enabling advanced visual search capabilities and personalized shopping experiences. However, the rise of AI image detection raises significant ethical and privacy concerns, as it can lead to increased surveillance and potential misuse of personal data. Additionally, biases in AI algorithms can result in unequal treatment across different demographic groups, necessitating ongoing efforts to ensure fairness and transparency in AI development and deployment.

Decided to dedicate my Independent project to AI and Machine Learning. I 
didn't get the chance to start the material, but I took a glance over the 
instruction, and I am excited to get the project underway.

Spent the day setting up my kaggle notebook and reviewing the introductory 
info on fastai. Next week I will begin work on the actual project.

## 2024-05-15
Implemented code snippets on Kaggle. I will continue to expand on the 
already built code that I copy and pasted
